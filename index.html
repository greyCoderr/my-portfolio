                    <h3>My Story</h3>
                    <p>I've been doing Web Design & Development since I was 18 years old. Back in junior high school, we had a subject on frontend development—that's where my interest first sparked. I'm passionate about design and problem-solving, and I enjoy creating modern user-friendly experiences online.</p><br>                                        
                    <p>I started pursuing backend development (Java) when I was 19 years old. It was during the summer—I felt bored, and that feeling gave me the urge to study and dive into backend development. It sparked my curiosity about how software and applications work, which led me to explore advanced topics like Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structure.</p>

          This project was developed for my 2nd Semester Final Performance Task during my first year of college.
          It tracks player statistics such as points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, and fouls.
          The system is designed for officiating staff,making their work faster
          and more efficient by allowing them to input data directly on their devices instead of manually writing on paper-based stat sheets.

          <p>This project was developed for our 1st Semester Final Performance Task. It manages customer orders based on their preferences. 
          The system is designed for cashiers to easily list, find,
          and track customer orders more efficiently than traditional handwritten notes.</p>

          <h3>Kopra Price Conversion<span class="project-number">03</span></h3>
          <p>This was my first project as a freelance Java developer.
          The system is console-based that converts the price of kopra, whether it's still in production or still on the tree.
          It also features an easy way to calculate the percentage of profit shared between the farmer and their helper or laborer.
          This program is essential for coconut farmers and komprada business owners.</p>

          The system helps quickly list and calculate the total cost of orders and makes it easier to find a customer's desired items—faster
          and more efficiently than using traditional paper-based order sheets.</p>
